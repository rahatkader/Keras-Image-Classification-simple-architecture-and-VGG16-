# Keras Image Classification using simple CNN architecture and VGG16

This is an example code for image classification using Convolutional Neural Network With TensorFlow's Keras API. Here I implemented two models

- Simple CNN model
- VGG16

## Dataset
Dataset can be download from: [Link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data)

The dataset contain three file.
- SimpleSubmission.csv
- train.zip
- test.zip

For my experiment I only used train.zip. I mount my google drive and save the data as following:
- Cats_and_Dogs
  - train
    - cats (0-499)
    - dogs (0-499)
  - test
    - cats (550-649)
    - dogs (550-649)
  - val
    - cats (500-549)
    - dogs (500-549)

So, I used 1000 images for training, 100 images for validation and 200 images for testing.
